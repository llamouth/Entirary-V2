## ‚ú® Discover Your Perfect Getaway with Precision ‚ú®

Entirary isn't just another travel recommendation engine. We leverage the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to understand your unique travel preferences and match you with destinations that truly resonate. Forget generic lists ‚Äì Entirary dives deep to find hidden gems and popular spots that align with your individual tastes.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Personalized Recommendations:** Our RAG-based system analyzes your preferences with remarkable accuracy, going beyond basic filters.
* **Precise Similarity Matching:** We use vector embeddings to understand the semantic similarity between your preferences and destination characteristics.
* **Rich Destination Information:** Get comprehensive details about recommended locations, helping you make informed decisions.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** Easily input your preferences and explore tailored suggestions powered by React.
* **Seamless Exploration:** Discover new possibilities you might never have considered.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Entirary employs a sophisticated process to deliver your ideal travel recommendations:

1.  **Preference Input:** You tell us about your ideal trip ‚Äì your interests (e.g., hiking, museums, food), travel style (e.g., budget-friendly, luxurious, adventurous), desired atmosphere (e.g., relaxing, vibrant, historical), and more.
2.  **Embedding Generation:** Your preferences are converted into a numerical vector embedding using **Google Gemini** via the `@google/generative-ai` library. This embedding captures the semantic meaning of your input.
3.  **Vector Database Retrieval:** This preference embedding is then used to query our **PostgreSQL database** (with the **vector extension**) to find destination embeddings that are semantically similar. We use the cosine distance (`<->`) to measure this similarity.
4.  **Recommendation Generation (RAG):** The retrieved destination information, along with your original preferences, is used by a generative model (likely Google Gemini) to create personalized recommendations and descriptions, highlighting why these destinations are a good fit for you.
5.  **Tailored Suggestions:** You receive a curated list of destinations, ordered by their similarity to your preferences, with detailed explanations.
